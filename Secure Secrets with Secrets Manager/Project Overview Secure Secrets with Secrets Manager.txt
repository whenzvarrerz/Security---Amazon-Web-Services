Secure Secrets with Secure Manager
AWS Secrets Manager
A service that allows users to securely store, manage, and rotate their application and database
credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information throughout their lifecycle.


In this project, I will demonstrate secure credential management by identifying insecure
credential storage in web app, using GitHub's secret scanning to prevent risky code pushes, updating the app to securely store and retrieve credentials via AWS Secrets Manager, and verifying that the secured code can be safely shared publicly without risking exposure of sensitive information.

Tech Stack / Resources:
Amazon S3 (Object Storage, Management, Security)
AWS Secrets Manager (Security, Management)
AWS IAM (Security Management)
GitHub (Version Control, Collaboration, Project Management, Code Hosting)

=======
AWS Secrets Manager is like a secure safe where you can store your important keys and passwords. 
Instead of keeping them in an unlocked drawer where anyone can find them, you lock them in this safe and give only trusted people (like applications or services) the combination to access them when needed, keeping everything protected.

GitHub is like a shared digital notebook where a team of writers can collaborate. Each writer can add, edit, or suggest changes to the story (code), keep track of different versions, and safely store everything in a locker, all while working together seamlessly.
