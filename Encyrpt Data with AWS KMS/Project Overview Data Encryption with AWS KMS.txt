Data Encryption with AWS KMS
AWS KMS - Key Management Service
Protect your data from unauthorized access and ensure the right people can see and use it.

AWS KMS is like a magical lockbox for your secrets. Only those with the special key can open it, 
and the KMS makes and guards those keys to keep your stuff safe. 

Encryption protects data by converting it into a secure, unreadable format that only authorized users with 
specific encryption keys can decrypt and access. You use AWS KMS to create and manage these keys. 

This project involves encrypting a DynamoDB with KMS key, adding and retrieving data to test the encryption, observing how AWS prevents unauthorized access, and granting specific users access to the encrypted data. 

This ensures data security while allowing the right people to use it.
