Threat Detection with GuardDuty

In this project, I will deploy a vulnerable web application, steal credentials, steal sensitive
data with those credentials, detect and analyze attack with GuardDuty, and implement malware 
protection to secure data. 

COMPROMISE IS FOR EDUCATION PURPOSE ONLY!

Amazon CloudFront - global content delivery network for data with low latency and 
		    higher transfer speeds.

		    secure, and durable storage for data accessed over the Internet.

Amazon CloudFormation - uses text-based templates (JSON or YAML) to define provision 
		     infrastructure as a code. 

OWASP Juice Shop - deliberately insecure web application
